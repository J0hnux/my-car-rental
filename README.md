## Clark Cars 
is a car rental website developed using NextJS and ReactJS. To style the website a combination of Tailwind and SCSS were used. The website is not yet fully developed, what it lacks is the backend and a few things as well. Also, there are other design aspects that it lacks, like animation, loading skeleton and so much more. I am thinking of changing the Category section into a centered stacked carousel which only appears on low width screens to make it more user friendly and for aesthetic as well.
